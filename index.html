    		<h2>ABOUT ME</h2>

 			<img src='Assets/images/profile.jpg' style='float: left; width: 25%'/>
 			<p>I am an eight semester Computer Science Student that is starting to learn web development,
            other interesting topics about my carreer that I like are Mobile Applications, Databases and Data Science.
            My hobbies outside classes are very varied, I like to play sports (soccer, basketball, softball) and I like
            to exercise mostly doing crossfit. 
                My favorite tv show is Sillicon Valley because of the computer Science references.
            I grew up in a small town 2 hours from Monterrrey called Nuevo Laredo and I have lived in Monterrey for almost 4 years now. 
            I expect to look back at this first portfolio and laugh because of how raw this is and obviously expect to get better at coding and learning
            all the little nuances of HTML,CSS.
